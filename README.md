## Abstraction
> Abstraction is the implementation on an object that contains the same essential properties and actions we can find in the original object we are representing.

## Encapsulation
> Encapsulatiion is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators. It's major benefit is that it reduces system complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the outside world.

*Accessor*: a method used to ask an object about itself, usually in OOP in the form of a property with a get 'accessor' method.<br/>
*Mutator*: a public method used to modify the state on an object, by hiding the exact implementation how the data gets modified.

## Inheritance
> Inheritance is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object.

*Subclass*: a modular, derivative class, that inherits one or more properties from aanother class (it's *superclass*).<br/>
*Superclass*: establishes a common interface and/or foundation of functionality which specialized *subclassed* can inherit.

## Polymorphism
> One name, many forms - poly-*(many)*-morph-*(forms)*-ism, refers to the ability to take multiple form.

*Overriding*: decision to use which method is used at runtime.<br/>
*Overloading*: decision to use which method is made at compile time.
