## Abstraction
> Abstraction is a process of exposing essential feautures of an entity by hiding the other irrelevant details.
- Reduce complexity and increase efficiency
- An entity can have multiple abstractions

## Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is the process of putting data and the operations that can be performed on given data into a single container.
- anyone can use the module (class/struct/...) without knowing the concrete implementation
- encapsulation leads to data hiding, but that is not it's main intent

## Inheritance
> Inheritance is the process of creating a module from an existing one. The new module may have some addition properties and functionality.

## Polymorphism
> Poly-*(many)*-morph-*(forms)*-ism, refers to the ability to take multiple forms.
- Allows one to invoke derived module methods through it's base module
